[{"categories":["SLAM"],"contents":"In July we began modifying a simulator - FlightGoggles developed by MIT. The simulator utilized the Unity engine with ray tracing, which enabled rendering of photorealistic images that can be used for perception algorithm development. Our modification allowed us to add custom gates to the scene, as well as a thirst-person view mode that can visualize light trail of the drone flying through a trajectory.\n","permalink":"https://liu-xiaoya.github.io/jessicaliu.github.io/blog/post.4/","tags":["UAV Technology","Flight Control","Speed \u0026 Agility"],"title":"Simulation Development"},{"categories":["Experiment"],"contents":"The ADR team is thrilled to announce our latest milestone: the successful autonomous drone racing within the UTIAS MarsDome. As we gear up for the world\u0026rsquo;s largest autonomous drone racing competition in April 2025 in Abu Dhabi, the MarsDome will serve as our primary training ground.
